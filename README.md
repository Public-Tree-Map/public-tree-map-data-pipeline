# public-tree-data

Public Tree Map uses open datasets to document publicly owned park + street trees in Santa Monica, California. We're working to add data about other LA county public trees. Please see below for more information about the data sources and project.

## Running the Pipeline Locally

Prerequisites:
- `make`
- `node`

After a fresh clone, run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules.

To run the full pipeline, which will download the latest tree data and all
images, run:

```bash
make release
```

To skip lengthy network requests, you can run a smaller version of the pipeline
with:

```bash
make local-only
```

See the `Makefile` for other rules that are available.

### Viewing the Logs

The various scripts that makeup the pipeline rely on reading/writing to stdin 
and stdout, so the scripts can't log to stdout like you'd expect. Instead, they
write to a log file that's located at tmp/log.txt. If you'd like to watch logs
as they happen, simply run:

```bash
tail -f tmp/log.txt
```

### Command Documentation

#### find_missing_species.py
This covers how to run the find_missing_species.py script. Let's start with the command line options and what they do:
```shell script
python find_missing_species.py -u <inventory url> -s <known species csv file> -o <output file>
```

`-u`: This is the url to download the tree inventory csv from santa monica. This data must also contain the column, `Species ID`, which is the species id. If not specified, it defaults to `https://data.smgov.net/resource/w8ue-6cnd.csv?$limit=50000`

`-s`: This specifies the csv file containing all known species ids. This script expects the species id in the column named `Species ID`. If not specified, it defaults to `data/species_attributes.csv`

`-o`: This specifies the name of the output csv file. If not specified it prints the csv file to stdout (aka the command line).


Here are some examples:
```shell script
 python find_missing_species.py -h # this shows you all the options (and explanations)

# this grabs data from the santa monica trees dataset and saves them to missing_trees.csv
python find_missing_species.py -o missing_trees.csv

# uses all the defaults and prints the output to the command line
python find_missing_species.py
```

### General Thoughts on the Pipeline

We don't want a server. To avoid this, we serve static data as JSON via a Google 
Cloud bucket. This has a number of benefits, namely cost and client simplicity.

The pipeline in general works like this:

- Start with tree data provided by Santa Monica.
- End with one JSON file that can be used to render the map, and a series of 
  JSON files that represent the details of each individual tree.
- In between, we break down each augmentation/alteration of the data into a
  series of distinct processes, each of which reads from stdin and writes to
  stdout. Examples include doing the initial parse of the CSV, and finding
  images for each tree.
- Each of these scripts are written and documented extensively.
- The Makefile composes these scripts into a set of routines.
- CircleCI will run the `make release` script nightly to update the data.
